# Reflections

Throughout this tutorial, you have learned how to use Checkov to identify and fix various security misconfigurations in an IaC project. Integrating automated security scanning into the development workflow is a useful way to catch vulnerabilities early. Tools like Checkov make it easier to maintain secure infrastructure by providing fast security checks, which allow for quicker fixes. 

It is important to recognize the limitations of automated security checks. Checkov can only recognize security issues that are written in its ruleset. Some vulnerabilities can go unnoticed if there are no specific rules to check for those. There could be potential for false positives within some scans. While Checkov is an important tool for security scanning, it should be complemented with manual reviews and more security checks.
