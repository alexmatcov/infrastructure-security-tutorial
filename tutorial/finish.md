Throughout this tutorial, you have learned how to use Checkov to identify and fix various security misconfigurations in an IaC project. Integrating automated security scanning into the development workflow is a useful way to catch vulnerabilities early. Tools like Checkov make it easier to maintain secure infrastructure by providing fast security checks, which allow for quicker fixes. 

It is important to recognize the limitations of automated security checks. Checkov can only recognize security issues that are written in its ruleset, and its effectiveness depends on the quality and coverage of those rules. Some vulnerabilities can go unnoticed if there are no specific rules to check for those, or if the infrastructure code uses new or custom resources that are not yet supported. There could also be potential for false positives, where the tool fails issues that are not actually a risk in your specific context, which can lead to unnecessary or extensive alerts. 

Automated tools like Checkov are important for quickly identifying common misconfigurations and enforcing baseline security standards, but they are not a substitute for human expertise. Manual reviews are essential for understanding your infrastructure and catching subtle issues that automated scans may miss. Combining automated scanning with regular manual reviews will help create a more secure project. 

Ultimately, security should be a combined approach of both automated tools and manual reviews. Automated tools like Checkov provide fast feedback for a large variety of common security issues. However, manual review will help ensure that there are no more additional security issues that can't be easily detected. Both of these approaches together will create a more secure application. 

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this tutorial, you should now be confident in the following learning outcomes:

- Understand the importance of Infrastructure as Code security and its role in DevSecOps workflows.
- Identify common security misconfigurations in Terraform code.
- Install and configure Checkov for static analysis of IaC.
- Use Checkov to scan Terraform projects and interpret the results, including the vulnerability classifications.
- Remediate critical security findings in Terraform code. 
- Demonstrate the scan-fail-fix-pass cycle for infrastructure security.
- Integrate Checkov into a CI/CD pipeline to automate security scanning. 
- Reflect on the impact of automated IaC security scanning in the software development lifecycle.
