# Integrating with CI/CD pipeline

This is where we explain why it is good to add it to the workflow because it is easily integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. 

Then we will show how you can add it to the pipeline (we can do in many ways https://www.checkov.io/4.Integrations/GitHub%20Actions.html)

Maybe we guide them to do it with Github Actions? But if it isn't possible I think pre-commit hooks would be really easy.
